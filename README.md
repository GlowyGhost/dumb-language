A language that can be in multiple forms, in one file extension, in one exe. This language was started following tlaceby's typescript tutorial ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_2VhOvlMk4UHGqYCLWc6GO8FaPl8fQTh ) Nearly the WHOLE project is made following the tutorial so a big thanks to him.




INSTALLATION INTO COMMAND LINE WHICH DOESNT WORK YET (Windows):
1. Download the correct exe for your computer.
2. Put the exe somewhere safe.
3. Open your Environment Variables.
4. Create a new variable in the user section.
5. Name it anything, preferably the actual name of the language (which I haven't decided on yet).
6. Put in the path to the exe into the variable.




There will be a more info on how to use in the future when the language is at v1.0
